"""Magika: AI-powered file type detection.

Magika uses a deep learning model to detect file content types with high
accuracy, even for files with missing or misleading extensions.

Basic usage:
    >>> from magika import Magika
    >>> m = Magika()
    >>> result = m.identify_bytes(b"# Hello\nprint('world')")
    >>> print(result.output.label)
    python

Note: For batch processing of many files, prefer identify_paths() over
calling identify_path() in a loop -- it's significantly more efficient.
